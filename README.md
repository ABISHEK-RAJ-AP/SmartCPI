# Smart Compiler Infrastructure (SmartCPI)

SmartCPI is a groundbreaking compiler infrastructure built using Python, designed to leverage advanced machine learning algorithms to optimize and dynamically configure compilation processes. This innovative approach allows SmartCPI to adapt to various programming tasks and environments, dramatically improving compiler efficiency and reducing build times.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Optimization**: Utilizes predictive models to dynamically set compilation flags and options, optimizing performance based on the project's requirements and historical data.
- **Dynamic Analysis Tools**: Incorporates tools that provide real-time feedback on code quality, identifying potential bottlenecks and performance issues during compilation.
- **Compiler Configuration Recommender System**: Offers intelligent recommendations for compiler configurations that could potentially enhance performance, tailored to similar past projects.
- **Automated Performance Testing**: Features an automated suite of performance tests that run on compiled programs to measure and compare the effects of different compiler settings, aiding in continuous performance improvement.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary development language.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning models.
- **TensorFlow**: For more complex predictive modeling.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the compiler environment to ensure consistency across different platforms.
- **GitHub Actions**: For CI/CD pipelines to automate tests and deployments.
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Used for storing and processing large datasets of compilation parameters and outcomes.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
